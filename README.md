# GitClub

This is an example application based on GitHub that's meant to model GitHub's
permissions system. The app is implemented in a number of backend languages,
which all expose a common API that is consumed by a React frontend (in the
`frontend/` folder).

For more information, check out one of the backend implementations linked below.
## Backends
- [Flask SQLAlchemy Backend](backends/flask-sqlalchemy)
- [Flask SQLAlchemy Backend (with sqlalchemy-oso integration library)](backends/flask-sqlalchemy-oso)
- [Rails Backend](backends/rails)
## Frontend
